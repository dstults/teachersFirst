### The Sales Pitch
Let's say you're a gym -- or let's say you're a school -- or let's say you're just a stay-at-home parent trying to part-time tutor but have trouble keeping track of everybody and their classes...well, we've got you covered!

For the low, low price of _free_ you can have your very own all-in-one, custom-built Customer Resources Manager (CRM) system that allows you to easily manage ever-increasing scales of students and teachers or coaches, and what's the catch? There is none. It works well, it's super easy to use, and the feedback from all our clients is that they are absolutely enchanted by it.
